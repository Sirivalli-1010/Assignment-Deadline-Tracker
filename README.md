  <strong>🚀 Assignment Deadline Tracker</strong><br/>
  <em>“Never Miss a Deadline: Smart Assignment Tracker for Students.”
</em>
</p>

---

## 📖 Project Description
✨ *Problem Statement:Students often struggle to manage multiple assignments across various subjects, leading to missed deadlines, poor time management, and increased stress.

💡 *Proposed Solution:Students often struggle to track multiple assignments and deadlines, leading to missed submissions and stress. Traditional methods like notes or planners are inefficient and don’t provide reminders or study suggestions. There is a need for a digital tool that organizes assignments, sends timely alerts, and helps plan study time efficiently.


🎯 *Target Users / Use Cases: 

➤College and school students managing multiple subjects.

➤Teachers or mentors tracking assignments for a class.

➤A student adds all weekly assignments and gets notified before deadlines.

➤A user checks a visual calendar to plan their study schedule.
